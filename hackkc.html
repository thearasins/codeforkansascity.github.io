            <h1 class="hack-details-blue"> What is Hack Kansas City?</h1>

            <p>A place for creating Civic Good by bringing together urbanists, hackers,
                government staff, developers, designers and community organizers
                to collaborate in building new solutions using publicly-released data,
                open technology and design processes.</p>

            <p>Frustrated with traditional hackathons? Hack KC starts with a two-day event, but we plan for projects to
                continue through the fall. Code for KC will support your team and help you create a great civic
                project.</p>

            <p>This is a part of <a herf="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a></p>

            <h1 class="hack-details-red"> Who should come?</h1>

            <p>Anyone can participate. You just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
                At the very least we need:
            <ul>
                <li> People with vision and passion</li>
                <li> People with expertise in all sorts of areas (see project ideas below)</li>

            </ul>
            </p>

            <h1 class="hack-details-blue"> What can I work on?</h1>

            <p>We have projects planned, but if you have an idea, let's hear it. Planned projects include:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt> Helping neighborhoods</dt><dd>Build an app to help neighborhood leaders and members to use information to solve problems.
                    For example, what new businesses are opening? What building demolitions are planned?
                    What upcoming construction projects will affect the neighborhood?
